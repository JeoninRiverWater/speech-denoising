# Audio Denoising

Audio Denoising project for the Deep Learning course at Tsinghua University, Spring semester 2021.

## Code organization

    __init__.py
    LibriSpeech.py
    NoiseMixer.py
    tests.py
    UrbanSound8K.py

## Quick start

### Environment setup
Clone this repository to your system.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/hmartelb/audio-denoising.git
```

Make sure that you have Python 3 installed in your system. Also, Pytorch 1.5 or above needs to be installed. Check the [official installation guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to set it up according to your system requirements and CUDA version.

It is recommended to create a virtual environment to install the dependencies. Open a new terminal in the master directory, activate the virtual environment and install the dependencies from requirements.txt by executing this command:

```
$ (venv) pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Datasets

We use datasets of clean speech data and noise, which are combined to produce the training data for our denoising models. 

### LibriSpeech (Speech data)
* Dataset download: [http://www.openslr.org/12](http://www.openslr.org/12)
* Torchaudio documentation: [https://pytorch.org/audio/stable/datasets.html#librispeech](https://pytorch.org/audio/stable/datasets.html#librispeech)

### UrbanSounds8K (Noise data)
